# Granite.js

Granite.js is a front-end component library from addapptation, built to render formatted JSON as PWA-ready DOM elements.

## Getting Started

addapptations server-side logic calls the requested micro(s) and writes a DOM element with a unique id.

```html
<div id="a0R1I00000FfTXsUAN-granite"></div>
```

Sample function call:

```js
granite_template(templateBlock, jsonTheme);
```

...and those JSON objects might look like this:
